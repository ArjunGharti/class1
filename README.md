# class1

Hi Class this the first class on Integration part of the DevOps. As the platform suggests we will be using Git as our integration 
tool and GitHub as end point

## Topic To Cover
   - Setting up Git
   - Collaborating with someone else's code
      * Forking
      * Working on your Fork
      * Merging the code
      
      
## Requirments
  - Computer
  - Mood to learn 
  
  
## Components

The Repo (**repository** - the content of the git ) consists of three main file. 
  - Dockerfile: This is a container ( code base to package the code). This will be touched later if we have time 
  - Jenkinsfile: This will be used to build your code. This will be touched later too
  - main.go: A simple web package written in go. This will be used an example of a software tool written by you. Code really doesnt matter as of now.
  
## First step

This is the command collabroative repo that everyone will be working of against. I will dedicate a branch (think it as your own channel)
for everone in the class so make sure to make changes in your branch and push it to it. Coming ( A todo video). Every branch will have 
specific instruction on what they need to. Once done push it to your own git and then merge with the branch. At this point slack channel
**siknucha** will notify you of the build. If no notifications on your branch than you must be missing something.

Have FUN
